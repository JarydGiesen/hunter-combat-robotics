# Video Upload Instructions

To add your hero video:

1. Name your video file `hero-video.mp4`

Your video should be:
- MP4 format (H.264 codec recommended)
- 1920x1080 resolution or similar
- Under 15MB for good loading performance
- Around 10-30 seconds long (it will loop)

The video will auto-play muted and loop continuously in the background.
